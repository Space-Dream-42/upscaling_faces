# upscaling_faces

This project was develeped in 2019 for the german [federal artificial intelligence competition](https://www.bw-ki.de/). I tried to programm a neural net from scratch and train it for the purpose to upscale images of faces. I aquired my knowledge from [this](https://youtu.be/CS4cs9xVecg) astonishing youtube playlist by Andrew NG. Unfortunately it didn't work, because for each input I got the same [output](upscaling_faces/Erstelltes Bild.jpg). One of the reasons why it didn't work is probably, that the classical neural net has a lack of translation invariance and locality.
